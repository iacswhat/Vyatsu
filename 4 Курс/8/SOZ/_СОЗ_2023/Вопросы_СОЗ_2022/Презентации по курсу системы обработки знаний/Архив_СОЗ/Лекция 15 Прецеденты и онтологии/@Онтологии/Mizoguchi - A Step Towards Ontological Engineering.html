   content-oriented research?</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">Content-oriented research
   is a great attempt of knowledge sharing with humans and computers.

   has been accepted. The objective of Content-oriented research is
   to get rid of such a misleading understanding about AI research
   and to provide effective theories and techniques enabling
   </FONT>Åg<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">Knowledge
   accumulation</FONT>Åh<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ"> and

   which do play critical roles in the next generation knowledge
   processing.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">2.2 How is it possible to
   come up with general theories of content for such a variety of
   domain knowledge?</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">It is true that each branch
   of sciences has established their own knowledge respectively. On
   the other hand, computer science has pursued domain-independent
   theories and techniques treating </FONT>Åg<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">information</FONT>Åh<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">

   obtained by abstracting things existing in all the domains. It is
   thanks to appropriate abstraction and careful consideration about
   them. Similarly, content-oriented research tries to exploit
   abstraction and decomposability of knowledge providing
   sophisticated guidelines and tools for understanding and model
   building of the target world(See 5.1).</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">2.3 Why ontology instead of
   knowledge?</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">It is true that knowledge
   is domain-dependent, and hence knowledge engineering which
   directly investigates such knowledge has been suffering from a
   rather serious difficulty caused by its specificity and diversity.
   However, ontology is different. In the ontology research we
   investigate knowledge in terms of its origin and elements from
   which knowledge is constructed. Hierarchical structure of concepts
   and decomposability of knowledge are exploited to deeply
   investigate primitives of knowledge as well as background theories
   of knowledge which enables us to avoid the difficulties knowledge
   engineering has faced with.</FONT></P>

   research neglect formalism-oriented research?</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">Although it has a plan to
   improve the unhealthy tendency of AI community in which

   agreements about the representation of particular domain theories.
   In the knowledge sharing context, ontologies are specified in the
   form of definitions of representational vocabulary. A very simple
   case would be a type hierarchy, specifying classes and their
   subsumption relationships. Relational database schemata also serve
   asÅ@ontologies by specifying the relations that can exist in some

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">The above opinion is based on
that there is no clear boundary between ontology and knowledge. It is
a reasonable understanding when we think of Cyc&#91;Lenat, 95&#93;
whose upper part is definitely an ontology and the whole seems to be
a knowledge base. But, the above opinion is somewhat misleading,
since there is no clear definition of a knowledge base. My answer to
the question is that we need to introduce a relativity when we
understand an ontology. That is, if we think of a rule base of an
expert system as an example of a knowledge base, an ontology is
apparently different from the rule base because the rule base is
based on the creator</FONT>Åf<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">s
conceptualization of the target world which the ontology specifies
and formalizes. And, the rule base never represents such a
conceptualization. Thus, such a relative relation between the both
clearly shows the essential difference of the two.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">(2) How an ontology is
different from the class hierarchy in object-oriented
paradigm?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">They are similar and further,
the developmental methodologies of an ontology and an object
hierarchy is also similar to each other in the upper stream. In the
lower stream, however, the former concentrate on declarative aspects
and the latter on performance-related aspects. Thus, the essential
difference between the two lies in that the ontology research
exploits declarative representation, while the OO paradigm is
intrinsically procedural. In OO paradigm, the meaning of class,
relations among classes, and methods are procedurally embedded and
they are implicit. The ontology paradigm, on the other hand,
descriptions are made declaratively in most cases to maintain
formality and explicitness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">(3) What</FONT>Åf<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">s
new? How is it different from taxonomy of concepts?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">An ontology contains a
taxonomy as its component as discussed in the above. So, it partially
implies a taxonomy. In general, a new term is rarely totally new.
Rather, it is usually coined by extending existing terms. The term
</FONT>Åg<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">ontology</FONT>Åh<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">
is not an exceptional case. It is a new term and concept including
existing concepts such as </FONT>Åg<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">taxonomy</FONT>Åh<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">,

model</FONT>Åh<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">, etc. by adding
formality, richer relations, explicit representation of stuff usually
left implicit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">(4)Are upper model and domain
ontology compatible with each other?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">An ontology should be
use-specific in engineering settings. People believe that a general
and neutral ontology is of useless. A typical example is task
ontology&#91;Mizoguchi, 92, 95a, 95b&#93; where domain knowledge has
to be organized so as to fit into the task model the task ontology
specifies. In such cases, neutral domain ontology cannot apply to any
problem without adjusting to the task structure. This discrepancy
suggests us a potential difficulty which we might face with. People
involved in upper ontology development advocate the importance of
general and use-neutral ontology which is hard to be accepted by
people who have to treat real world problems. Ideally, however, many
use-specific ontology could find some of the essential concepts in
use-independent ontology which should be inherited. We need more
effort to harmonize the both activities believing we will come up
with several possible upper ontologies one of which is really
agreeable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">(5) What is the computational
semantics of an ontology? Is it just a set of labels?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">This is one of the most
crucial points of the roles an ontology plays. Contrary to that an
ontology sometimes looks just a set of labels, it has deeper
computational semantics. I have proposed the following three levels
of ontologies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">Level 1: A structured
collection of terms. The most fundamental task in ontology
development is articulation of the world of interest, that is,
elicitation of concepts and identifying so-called is-a hierarchy
among them. These are indispensable to things to be an ontology.
Typical examples of ontologies at this level include topic
hierarchies found in internet search engines and tags used for
metadata description. Little definitions of the concepts are
made.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">Level 2: In addition to that
at the level 1 ontology, we can add formal definitions to prevent
unexpected interpretation of the concepts and necessary relations and
constraints also formally defined as a set of axioms. Relations are
much richer than those at the level one. Definitions are declarative
and formal to enable computers to interpret. The interpretability of
an ontology at this level enables computers to answer questions about
the models built based on the ontology. Many of the ontology building
efforts aim at those at this level.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">Level 3: The ontology at this
level is executable in the sense that models built based on the
ontology run using modules provided by some of the abstract codes
associated with concepts in the ontology. Thus, it can answer
questions about runtime performance of the models. Typical examples
of this type are found in task ontologies&#91;Mizoguchi,
92&#93;&#91;Breuker94&#93;&#91;Seta96&#93;&#91;Chandra
98&#93;.</FONT>Å@</P>

merits an ontology can provide?</FONT></P>

   terms, relations and constraints among them, and viewpoints for
   interpreting the phenomena and target structure common to the
   tasks they are usually engaged in. Any knowledge base built is
   based on a conceptualization possessed by the builder and is
   usually implicit. An ontology is an explication of the very
   implicit knowledge. Such an explicit representation of assumptions
   and conceptualization is more than a simple explication. Although
   it might be hard to be properly appreciated by people who have no
   experience in such representation, its contribution to knowledge
   reuse and sharing is more than expectation considering that the

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">N. Guarino and J. Sowa have
been independently conducting research on theories of ontology. The
both share the attitude towards philosophy. They both incorporate the
results obtained in philosophy as principles to design the top-level
ontology. Many of the practitioners have negative attitude to the
top-level ontology under which they are required to put their
ontology because they believe no use-independent ontology is useful.
In the case of building an ontology for a large scale knowledge base,
however, the validity of the knowledge base necessarily be justified
in terms of wider rage of tasks, that is, it needs to show its
generality rather than task-specific utility. Compliance with the
principled top-level ontology provides a good justification. Thus,
top-level ontology is important.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">Sowa</FONT>Åf<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">s
ontology is based on J. S. Peirce</FONT>Åf<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">s
idea of the firstness which is defined without assuming any other
things like human, iron, etc., the secondness which is defined

which provides an environment or context where the secondness works
like family, school, etc. He introduces two important concepts,
continuant and occurrent in addition to the three and obtains 12 top

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">Development of
machine-readable dictionaries has been done extensively in natural
language processing community where ontology has also been discussed
as the upper level model of the words/concepts structure. Typical
examples include WordNet
&#91;Miller93&#93;Å@&#91;WordNet&#93;,Å@EDR&#91;Yokoi,
95&#93;,Å@EuroWordNet&#91;EWN&#93;, Generalized Upper
Model&#91;GUM&#93;. Cyc is not a dictionary, but is a huge common
sense knowledge base whose upper level structure is an ontology. One
thing to note here is the activity done in the ad hoc committee in
ANSI where they intend to design a reference ontology(RO)
(http://ksl-web.stanford.edu/onto-std/) by aligning the upper level
model of each of WordNet, Cyc and EDR. It is not easy to attain the
goal, but it is of worth to try, I think.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">Another activity to note is
that about standardization about metadata such as Dublin Core&#91;DC
97&#93;, MCF: Meta Content Framework &#91;MCF 97&#93; and RDF:
Resource Description Framework &#91;RDF 97&#93; in W3C. Dublin Core
is the first de facto standard of the metadata descriptors. MCF was
proposed to W3C as a candidate of the framework for metadata
representation and extended and elaborated into RDF which is becoming
as a standard. RDF introduces XML for its syntax.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">XML&#91;XML&#93; is a
simplified version of SGML which is a powerful markup language
definition language and has been widely used in document description
for years. XML is equipped with several powerful hyper-reference
functions to fit the internet environment. The good things of XML is
that the users can define their own tags which shows not only
structure information of the document but also its semantic
information for various uses of the document to enable semantic
interoperation. For example, we can design an intelligent
instructional player of a teaching material as an XML document by
sharing a set of tags for explicating the roles of the portion of
document and controlling the interpretation. It can
</FONT>Åg<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">Play</FONT>Åh<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">
the XML document adaptively to the performance of the learners.
Further, we could formalize the set of tags to specify the
performance of such instructional players. While tags in metadata
description generally form a level one ontology, such tags can be
those at the second level. Intelligent players with plug &amp; play
capability with shared XML tags is expected to be promising with Java
implementation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">An ontology provides us with a

this condenser was broken, so I replaced it with the new
one.</FONT>Åh<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ"> Even if you do not

cause</FONT>Åh<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ"> of the fault. If
the TV set was very new, however, you might start to suspect
another(deeper) reason which caused to break the condenser. An
excessive current might have flown through the condenser because of a
short in somewhere or a lot of heat might have been radiated by a
device near it, etc.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">The above two ways of
understanding causes of a fault are different from each other. The

engineering cope with the variety of models?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">I have declared that the
ultimate goal of Ontological engineering is to establish the
foundation for modeling all the objects, strictly speaking what the
computer science needs to tackle, existing in the world. This
statement needs some additional explanations to make it
convincing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">The issue here is the
diversity of </FONT>Åg<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">objects</FONT>Åh<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">.
In the example of diagnostic tasks, the possible objects include a
motor, TV set, car, electric plant, chemical plant, telephone
network, etc. which varies in domains and size. And, further, tasks
performed in each of the domains require the models tailored to them.
In summary, theory of models, and hence ontological engineering
should cope with the great variety of models.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">The above is only concerned
with the models of </FONT>Åg<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">things</FONT>Åh<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">.

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">Model building requires a set
of building blocks and specifications or theories of the composition
of them. It is true that concrete building blocks are heavily
domain-dependent. But the exhaustiveness or completeness is not the
goal of the highest priority. Rather, we can stay at the right
abstraction level at which we can find sizable classes of models.
Each of them allows us to build an ontology by concentrating the
hierarchical structure of concepts to find the class-wide common
characteristics among concepts. Ontological engineering also
contributes to formation of theories of model building
domain-independently by building methodologies for building and
utilizing ontologies, description language, etc.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">The more important issue here
is the class of computational level of an ontology, that is, the
three-level architecture of an ontology mentioned earlier. I have to
admit an ontology at the level 3 is not easy to design for various
objects. But, one at the level 2 can be reasonably general and
effective in forming a theory for various objects.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">We have made a comprehensive
discussion on an ontology together with trends in ontology research.
Let us pick some topics again before closing this article.</FONT></P>

<OL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">Standardization of an
   ontology</FONT>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">Standardization has both of
   good and bad sides. Some people tend to stress the bad side. And
   others tend to think Ontology should exist as the universal one
   considering its original meaning in philosophy and say it is
   almost impossible for all the people to agree on
   </FONT>Åg<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">A universal
   ontology</FONT>Åh<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">. I
   understand such speculations, but still want to take the position
   that we easily find the more in good side than those in bad side
   of an ontology. Knowledge sharing and reuse and semantic
   interoperability of documents, models and systems do requires
   standard ontology, at least, shared common ontology.</FONT></P>
   
   <P>Å@</P></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">An agreement of what an
   ontology is</FONT>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">It is pity that we still do
   not come to an agreement of what an ontology is. Rather, ontology
   researchers seem to have come to an agreement that
   </FONT>Åg<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">Let</FONT>Åf<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">s
   not discuss the definition of an ontology</FONT>Åh<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">.
   I can see at least three different kinds of attitudes towards an
   ontology: (a) Natural language processing, (b) Knowledge-based
   systems, and (c) Philosophical modeling of the world. NL people
   would like to discuss </FONT>Åg<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">vocabulary</FONT>Åh<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">
   and </FONT>Åg<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">Lexicon</FONT>Åh<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">
   together with the meaning of each term in it keeping tasks such as
   text understanding in their mind. The KBS people, on the other
   hand, tend to stress the executability of components included in
   the ontology as building blocks of the knowledge
   </FONT>Å\<FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">based systems. People
   taking the philosophical attitude would like to think of rather
   universal upper model designed intended to govern the
   domain-specific ontologies. Each of them has reasonable
   justifications, which makes it difficult to come to an agreement
   in the near future.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="ÇlÇr Çoñæí©,HGê≥û≤èëëÃ">Further, it is interesting
   to view the differences in terms of cultural perspectives. US
   people tend to be pragmatic and hence they put reusability or
   interoperability as a primarily important criterion in ontology
   design. People in Europe would like to be more philosophical than
   US people and we Japanese stay in the middle and to nicely
   compromise the advantages of both.</FONT></P>
